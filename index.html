     Nutrition is very important at every stage. Fresh food is cooked everyday for the students who are unable to bring tiffin from their home. Our canteen is 
certified by FDA. Dal-rice is the favourite food of all the students which iserved hot in the recess time. The food quality and hygiene is regularly checked 
before it is served to the students. We also practice organic farming on a small scale so that we can regularly provide fresh agricultural vegetables. How and 
what a child eats today can have a huge impact on their adolescence and adulthood.
